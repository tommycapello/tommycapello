## Hello! 

My name is Tommy Capello and I recently completed Lambda School's Web Development program. I fell in love with the magic of software and enjoy learning all aspects of delivering a quality digital product. Prior to pursuing a career in software, I worked in Marketing Databases and applied technical skills to generate sales revenue as Account Manager. I am currently pursuing my first opportunity as a professional Full Stack Engineer.
