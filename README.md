Hello! My name is Tommy Capello and I recently completed Lambda School's Web Development program. I fell in love with the magic of software and enjoy learning all aspects of delivering a quality digital product experience. Prior to pursuing a career as a Full Stack Developer, I worked in Marketing Databases and applied technical skills to generate sales revenue as Account Manager. I am currently pursuing my first opportunity as a professional Developer.
